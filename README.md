## Sharpify - Base package

`Sharpify` is a package mainly intended to extend the core language using high performance implementations. The other 2 packages uses `Sharpify` as a dependency. But its core features can be useful in a variety of applications by themselves.

* ‚ö° Fully Native AOT compatible
* ü§∑ `Either<T0, T1>` - Discriminated union object that forces handling of both cases
* ü¶æ Flexible `Result` type that can encapsulate any other type and adds a massage options and a success or failure status. Flexible as it doesn't require any special handling to use (unlike `Either`)
* üèÑ Wrapper extensions that simplify use of common functions and advanced features from the `CollectionsMarshal` class
* `Routine` and `AsyncRoutine` bring the user easily usable and configurable interval based background job execution.
* `PersistentDictionary` and derived types are super lightweight and efficient serializable dictionaries that are thread-safe and work amazingly for things like configuration files.
* `SortedList<T>` bridges the performance of `List` and order assurance of `SortedSet`
* `PersistentDictionary` and variants provide all simple database needs, with perfected performance and optimized concurrency.
* `SerializableObject` and the `Monitored` variant allow persisting an object to the disk, and elegantly synchronizing modifications.
* üíø `StringBuffer` enables zero allocation, easy to use appending buffer for creation of strings in hot paths.
* `RentedBufferWriter{T}` is an allocation friendly alternative to `ArrayBufferWriter{T}` for hot paths.
* A üö£üèª boat load of extension functions for all common types, bridging ease of use and performance.
* `Utils.DateAndTime`, `Utils.Env`, `Utils.Math`, `Utils.Strings` and `Utils.Unsafe` provide uncanny convenience at maximal performance.
* üßµ `ThreadSafe<T>` makes any variable type thread-safe
* üîê `AesProvider` provides access to industry leading AES-128 encryption with virtually no setup
* üèãÔ∏è High performance optimized alternatives to core language extensions
* üéÅ More added features that are not present in the core language
* ‚ùó Static inner exception throwers guide the JIT to further optimize the code during runtime.
* ü´¥ Focus on giving the user complete control by using flexible and common types, and resulting types that can be further used and just viewed.

## Sharpify.Data

`Sharpify.Data` is an extension package, that should be installed on-top of `Sharpify` and adds a high performance persistent key-value-pair database, utilizing [MemoryPack](https://github.com/Cysharp/MemoryPack). The database support multiple types in the same file, 2 stage AES encryption (for whole file and per-key). Filtering by type, Single or Array value per key, and more...

* `Database` is the base type for the data base, it is key-value-pair based local database - saved on disk.
* `IDatabaseFilter<T>` is an interface which acts as an alternative to `DbContext` and provides enhanced type safety for contexts.
* `MemoryPackDatabaseFilter<T>` is an implementation which focuses on types that implement `IMemoryPackable<T>` from `MemoryPack`.
* `FlexibleDatabaseFilter<T>` is an implementation focusing on types which need custom serialization logic. To use this, you type `T` will need to implement `IFilterable<T>` which has methods for serialization and deserialization of single `T` and `T[]`. If you can choose to implement only one of the two.
* **Concurrency** - `Database` uses highly performant synchronous concurrency models and is completely thread-safe.
* **Disk Usage** - `Database` tracks inner changes and skips serialization if no changes occurred, enabling usage of periodic serialization without resource waste.
* **GC Optimization** - `Database` heavily uses pooling for encryption, decryption, type conversion, serialization and deserialization to minimize GC overhead, very rarely does it allocate single-use memory and only when absolutely necessary.
* **HotPath APIs** - `Database` is optimized for hot paths, as such it provides a number of APIs that specifically combine features for maximum performance and minimal GC overhead. Like the `TryReadToRentedBuffer<T>` methods which is optimized for adding data to a table.
* **Runtime Optimization** - Upon initialization, `Database` chooses specific serializers and deserializers tailored for specific configurations, minimizing the amount of runnable code during runtime that would've been wasted on different checks.

## Sharpify.CommandLineInterface

`Sharpify.CommandLineInterface` is another extension package that adds a high performance, reflection free and `AOT-ready` framework for creating command line and embedded interfaces

* Maintenance friendly model that depends on class that implement `Command` or `SynchronousCommand`
* `Arguments` is an abstraction layer over the inputs that validate during runtime according to user needs via convenient APIs.
* Configuration using a fluent builder pattern.
* Configurable output and input pipes, enable usage outside of `Console` apps, enabling the option for embedded use in any application.
* Automatic and structured general and command-specific help text.
* Configurable error handling with defaults.
* Super lightweight

## Methodology

* Backwards compatibility ‚ùå
* Stability at release ‚úÖ

As the name suggests - `Sharpify` intends to extend the core language features using high performance implementations. `Sharpify` or its extension packages are not guaranteed to be backwards compatible, and each release may contain breaking changes as they try to adapt to the latest language features. `.NET` has a very active community and many features will be added to the core language that will perform at some point better than what `Sharpify` currently offers, at which point these features will be removed from `Sharpify` to encourage users to use the core language features instead.

The decision to disregard backwards compatibility is based on the idea to only provide feature that **add** or **improve** current language features. This is to ensure that both the package remains relevant, and unbounded by old sub-par implementations, and to encourage users to adapt their code to new language features.

Even thought backwards compatibility is not guaranteed, `Sharpify` has very high coverage of unit tests, and should be completely stable upon release. All issues will be treated as **Urgent**.

If your packages / libraries use `Sharpify`, and you don't want to modify the code often, I recommend locking the dependency to a specific version which you test.
