`ThreadSafe<T>` is a special wrapper instance type that can make any other type thread-safe to be used in concurrency. 

It works by having a lock and limiting modification access to a single thread at a time.

You can access the value any time by using `ThreadSafe.Value`.

and modify the value using two functions

```csharp
public T Modify(Func<T, T> modificationFunc)
```
This both modifies the value and returns the result after modification.

or

```csharp
public T Modify(IModifier<T> modifier, T newValue)
```
This works similarly to the previous but uses a special `IModifier<T>` interface to reduce the memory allocation of the lambda/delegate.

# `IModifier<T>`

This interface will be explained using an example, lets say that we want the value to be counter, but used in parallel,

## Implementing the interface

```csharp
public class Adder : IModifier<int> {
    public int Modify(int value, int newValue) {
        return value + newValue;
    }
}
```

Then we can use this together with a `ThreadSafe<int>` value to modify it.

## Using the implemented class

```csharp
ThreadSafe<int> counter = new(0); // Initialize the counter
// Imagine we are inside another function that is executed in parallel
var modifier = new Adder(); // you can make this a readonly property or field to reduce memory allocations
var updated = counter.Modify(modifier, 1); // this will increment the value of the counter by 1 and return the result.
```

Using `ThreadSafe<T>` requires much less overhead than using a certain element of a concurrent collection to maintain a threadsafe value.
