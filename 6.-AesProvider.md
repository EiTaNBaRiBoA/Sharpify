`AesProvider` is a class that implements `IDisposable` and allows very easy usage of AES128 encryption and decryption.

## Static Methods

```csharp
public static string GeneratePassword(string password, int iterations = 991)
```
This generates a hashed password from a real password. This is useful for storing and verifying account credentials.

```csharp
public static bool IsPasswordValid(string password, string hashedPassword)
```
This will verify a hashed password against a real password.

## Instance Methods

Constructor:

```csharp
public AesProvider(string strKey)
```
Unlike the base classes of the language, this takes a key in the format of a `string`, and does all the magic of handling length, padding and such by itself, so that you only need the key to encrypt or decrypt.

Remember that this class implements `IDisposable`, make sure to dispose of it properly or use the `using` keyword or block.

Methods:

```csharp
public string Encrypt(string unencrypted)
public byte[] EncryptBytes(byte[] unencrypted)
public string Decrypt(string encrypted)
public byte[] DecryptBytes(byte[] encrypted)
```
These methods straight up encrypt or decrypt the `string` or `byte[]` input.
```csharp
public string EncryptUrl(string url)
public string DecryptUrl(string encryptedUrl)
```
These methods handle cases where the encrypted is formatted in `base64` so it can be used in urls and file-names and so on...

These methods are used for handling all the base needs of encryption and decryption.

For more advanced encryption or decryption you can use these:

```csharp
public ICryptoTransform CreateEncryptor()
public ICryptoTransform CreateDecryptor()
```
These will create an `ICryptoTransform` using the key and everything from the `AesProvider` instance. You can use it to encrypt and decrypt using streams and many more advanced options.

`ICryptoTransform` is also implementing `IDisposable` make sure to handle it appropriately.
