## Usage Examples

Lets see an high performance example, obviously, if you are using this package you care about performance, and here we appreciate that, a lot.

### Initialization

```csharp
using var database = Database.Create(new DatabaseConfiguration {
  Path = path, // local
  EncryptionKey = "mykey",
  Options = DatabaseOptions.SerializeOnUpdate | DatabaseOptions.IgnoreKeyCases
});
```

### CRUD

lets first create a value type that implements `IMemoryPackable` such as:

```csharp
[MemoryPackable]
public readonly partial record struct Dog(string Species, int Age, float Weight);
```

Notice the `MemoryPackable` attribute from [MemoryPack](https://github.com/Cysharp/MemoryPack), this will implement the `IMemoryPackable` interface behind the scenes using a source generator. `Database` utilizes this to enable unrivaled performance.

```csharp
database.Upsert<Dog>("Brian", new("Bipedal Talking Dog", 20));
Dog? brian = database.Get<Dog>("Brian"); // Get returns null if the key doesn't exist
// because SerializeOnUpdate options was chosen, it will handle this automatically
// otherwise use .Serialize() or .SerializeAsync()
```

### Database{T}

For simplicities sake, we will use the `Dog` record from the previous example.

```csharp
using var database = Database<Dog>.Create(new DatabaseConfiguration<Dog> {
  Path = path, // local
  EncryptionKey = "mykey",
  Options = DatabaseOptions.SerializeOnUpdate | DatabaseOptions.IgnoreKeyCases,
  ToByteArray = static d => MemoryPackSerializer.Serialize(d),
  ToT = static d => MemoryPack.Deserialize<Dog>(d)
});
```

We can see how we needed to implement the conversion functions `ToByteArray` and `ToT`, they enable `Database{T}` to have a consistent value type. Which makes many operation much faster, however during serialization, it needs to iterate through the whole database and convert all the values.

But, it also adds conveniences such as index getter and setter.

```csharp
database["Brian"] = new("Bipedal Talking Dog", 20);
Dog? brian = database["Brian"];
```
