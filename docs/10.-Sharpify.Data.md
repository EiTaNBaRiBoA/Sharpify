## Usage Examples

Lets see an high performance example, obviously, if you are using this package you care about performance, and here we appreciate that, a lot.

### Initialization

```csharp
using var database = Database.CreateOrLoad(new DatabaseConfiguration {
  Path = path, // local
  EncryptionKey = "mykey",
  SerializeOnUpdate = true,
  IgnoreCase = true
});
```

### CRUD

lets first create a value type that implements `IMemoryPackable` such as:

```csharp
[MemoryPackable]
public readonly partial record struct Dog(string Species, int Age, float Weight);
```

Notice the `MemoryPackable` attribute from [MemoryPack](https://github.com/Cysharp/MemoryPack), this will implement the `IMemoryPackable` interface behind the scenes using a source generator. `Database` utilizes this to enable unrivaled performance.

```csharp
database.Upsert<Dog>("Brian", new("Bipedal Talking Dog", 20));
Dog? brian = database.Get<Dog>("Brian"); // Get returns null if the key doesn't exist
// because SerializeOnUpdate options was chosen, it will handle this automatically
// otherwise use .Serialize() or .SerializeAsync()
// We also use the filter
var table = Database.CreateMemoryPackFilter<Dog>();
table.Upsert("Buster", new Dog("Buster", 5));
bool exists = table.TryGetValue("Buster", out Dog buster);
```

#### FlexibleDatabaseFilter{T}

As an alternative to `MemoryPackable` the database also has an option to create a `FlexibleDatabaseFilter{T}`. This filter can be used when you want to implement easy access to the existing apis with a type that can't implement `IMemoryPackable{T}`, one example would be collections.

For that the type itself, would need to implement the interface `IFilterable{T}`. If the type has the `MemoryPackable` attribute, it means the serializer knows how to handle it, it would be required to add practically a single line of code to each of the methods from `IFilterable{T}` to implement it. If some methods aren't required, you could simply `return null;`.

When your type lets say `TCustom` implements `IFilterable<T>`, the following method will become available:

```csharp
var table = Database.CreateFlexibleFilter<TCustom>();
```

this filter implements the same interface as the `MemoryPackFilter` and will support the same apis. To allow a very uniform and cohesive codebase.
