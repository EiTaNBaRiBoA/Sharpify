# Collections

Sharpify has multiple custom collections such as:

## SortedList{T}

`SortedList<T>` is a re-implementation of `List<T>` with custom crud operations:

* Add -> O(log n)
* Remove -> O(log n)
* Get by sorted index O(1) - i.e min is [0] and max is [length - 1], also second max is [length - 2]
* Space is still O(n)
* Option to disallow duplicates

The `SortedList<T>` also has convenience features, such as `AsSpan`, `Clear` methods, exposure of the `List<T>.Enumerator` which is an efficient struct, and also an implicit operator which can return the inner list in places which require `List<T>` (however be careful as the receiver may use the inner list and it may no longer maintain the features above)

## PersistentDictionary

`PersistentDictionary` is a thread-safe `Dictionary<string, string` that is optimized for concurrency. The abstract class provides most of the important implementation to allow all the features, and should be used as the type for the object when you want to use a `PersistentDictionary`.

`PersistentDictionary` has many convenience methods such as automatic conversions that allow getting any value that implements `IParsable` and adding any value that implements `IConvertible` which at the vary least are most of the primitive types in .NET

The main differences between the api of this and a regular dictionary is that it is best to use the async overloads

```csharp
// Upsert
public ValueTask UpsertAsync<T>(string key, T value) where T : struct, IConvertible
public virtual async ValueTask UpsertAsync(string key, string value)
// Retrieval
public async ValueTask<T> GetOrCreateAsync<T>(string key, T @default) where T : struct, IParsable<T>
public virtual async ValueTask<string> GetOrCreateAsync(string key, string @default)
```

you can also get values with a synchronous operation if you require by using `PersistentDictionary[key]`

but upsert is not available asynchronously due to the synchronization mechanisms that are used to optimize the concurrency

To configure the type for usage you can implement the class and it will show you the specific things required to make everything work. In addition, there are 2 built-in implementations:

* `LocalPersistentDictionary` is an implementation that serializes and restores the dictionary from a local path
* `LazyLocalPersistentDictionary` is an implementation that also serializes and restores the dictionary from a local path, doesn't maintain an in-memory version, allowing it to be garbage collected if it was even created, this is for very memory constrained scenarios. Reading from it, doesn't even create a dictionary.
