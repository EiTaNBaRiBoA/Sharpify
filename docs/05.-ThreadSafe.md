# ThreadSafe

`ThreadSafe<T>` is a special wrapper instance type that can make any other type thread-safe to be used in concurrency.

It works by having a lock and limiting modification access to a single thread at a time.

You can access the value any time by using `ThreadSafe.Value`.

and modify the value using the following method:

```csharp
public T Modify(Func<T, T> modificationFunc)
```

This both modifies the value and returns the result after modification.
