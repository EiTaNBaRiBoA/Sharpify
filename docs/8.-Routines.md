# Routines

Routines are special objects that contain a collection of actions and executes them once a specified interval has passed, until it is stopped. This was inspired by Coroutines from the Unity game engine.

## Routine

The default `Routine` is the simplest version, it has a collection of `Action`s and once every timer interval has passed they get executed sequentially.

## AsyncRoutine

`AsyncRoutine` is more complicated but more precise and more flexible, by providing a `CancellationTokenSource`, the `AsyncRoutine` can create tasks that will all run only while the source isn't cancelled.

In addition it can be initialized with a `RoutineOptions` that configures 2 important aspects:

1. `ThrowOnCancellation` will cause an exception to be thrown when the source is cancelled, if left out, the routine will gracefully cancel all the tasks and exit quietly.
2. `ExecuteInParallel` will configure the routine to execute the tasks concurrently and not sequentially which is the default.
