# Collections

Sharpify has multiple custom collections such as:

## SortedList{T}

`SortedList<T>` is a re-implementation of `List<T>` with custom crud operations:

* Add -> O(log n)
* Remove -> O(log n)
* Get by sorted index O(1) - i.e min is [0] and max is [length - 1], also second max is [length - 2]
* Space is still O(n)
* Option to disallow duplicates

The `SortedList<T>` also has convenience features, such as `AsSpan`, `Clear` methods, exposure of the `List<T>.Enumerator` which is an efficient struct, and also an implicit operator which can return the inner list in places which require `List<T>` (however be careful as the receiver may use the inner list and it may no longer maintain the features above)

## PersistentDictionary

`PersistentDictionary` is a thread-safe `Dictionary<string, string` that is optimized for concurrency. The abstract class provides most of the important implementation to allow all the features, and should be used as the type for the object when you want to use a `PersistentDictionary`.

`PersistentDictionary` has many convenience methods such as automatic conversions that allow getting any value that implements `IParsable` and adding any value that implements `IConvertible` which at the vary least are most of the primitive types in .NET

The main differences between the api of this and a regular dictionary is that it is best to use the async overloads

```csharp
// Upsert
public ValueTask UpsertAsync<T>(string key, T value) where T : struct, IConvertible
public virtual async ValueTask UpsertAsync(string key, string value)
// Retrieval
public async ValueTask<T> GetOrCreateAsync<T>(string key, T @default) where T : struct, IParsable<T>
public virtual async ValueTask<string> GetOrCreateAsync(string key, string @default)
```

you can also get values with a synchronous operation if you require by using `PersistentDictionary[key]`

but upsert is not available asynchronously due to the synchronization mechanisms that are used to optimize the concurrency

To configure the type for usage you can implement the class and it will show you the specific things required to make everything work. In addition, there are 2 built-in implementations:

* `LocalPersistentDictionary` is an implementation that serializes and restores the dictionary from a local path
* `LazyLocalPersistentDictionary` is an implementation that also serializes and restores the dictionary from a local path, doesn't maintain an in-memory version, allowing it to be garbage collected if it was even created, this is for very memory constrained scenarios. Reading from it, doesn't even create a dictionary.

## StringBuffer and AllocateStringBuffer

`StringBuffer` and `AllocatedStringBuffer` are unique ref structs that efficiently build a string from `ReadOnlySpan<char>`s, `char`s and any other `ISpanFormattable` implemented types. both require knowing the maximum potential length ahead of time, and they differ by the way buffer works, `StringBuffer` rents a buffer from the array pool and is still efficient in large capacities, while `AllocatedStringBuffer` works on a pre-allocated buffer and best used in conjunction with `stackalloc` on smaller buffers (less than 1024).

Both use internal indexes to properly append elements, requiring basically no tracking from the user.

* `StringBuffer` has a factory `Create(capacity, clearBuffer)` method, with `clearBuffer` being an optional argument that is used to enforce cleaning of the rented buffer (normally unnecessary). it also has a `Dispose` method, that works well with a `using` statement, which is responsible for returning the rented buffer, failure to dispose of `StringBuilder` will cause the rented buffer to be lost, and may degrade performance as the array pool will need to allocate a new one to replace it.
* `AllocatedStringBuffer` has a factory `Create(Span<char>)` method, that is best used with `stackalloc`, because of this it might be more scope limited, and has no `Dispose` method because it doesn't own the buffer.

### Appending

```csharp
public void Append(char c);
public void Append(ReadOnlySpan<char> str);
public void Append<T>(T value, ReadOnlySpan<char> format = default, IFormatProvider? provider = null) where T : ISpanFormattable {}
```

### Finalization (Get string)

```csharp
Allocate(bool trimIfShorter = true, bool trimEndWhiteSpace = false)
// trimIfShorter -> will trim the buffer to the end of the latest appended segment
// trimEndWhiteSpaces -> will trim white spaces at the end
ToString() // Will call Allocate(true, false)
implicit string operator // Will also call Allocate(true, false)
implicit ReadOnlySpan<char> operator // A readonly span of the same sequence of Allocate(true, false), but no allocation.
[Range] // Will allocate by range
```

### Example

```csharp
public string GetHello() {
  // Option 1 - Rented
  using var buffer = StringBuffer.Create(50); // The number is ballpark but overestimated
  // Option 2 - Stack Allocated
  var buffer = AllocatedStringBuffer.Create(stackalloc char[50]);
  
  buffer.Append("Hello");
  buffer.Append(' ');
  buffer.Append("Everyone");
  buffer.Append('!');
  return buffer;
  // We sample text is separated for api showcase.
}
// The implicit operator will kick in and Allocate(true, false)
// The returned result will be "Hello Everyone!"
```

In the functionality they are very similar in some use cases to a `StringBuilder` however, the types themselves are stack allocated,
and together with an option of either renting the buffer or stack allocating it as well, they are much more efficient.

* `StringBuffer` and `AllocatedStringBuffer` since their introduction are utilized almost everywhere in Sharpify, and the gains in maintainability with no degradation to performance are very noticeable.
